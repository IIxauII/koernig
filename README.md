##### An analog film tracker

## The Idea

for koernig was born when I started to develop a passion for shooting analog film. After purchasing multiple different cameras and exploring with different types of film I started to run into the issue that I would lose track of which film was shot on what camera or which films where sent to development (possibly already done with development and just waited for me to pick them up).

As a first POC & test I created multiple iOS Shortcuts based automations, together with a persistent data storage helper called DataJar, to track my analog films, where they were currently loaded into (which film in which camera), which film where shot, which where sent out for development etc.

After using this for a couple of weeks & being happy with the initial idea & concept I wanted to extend the functionality. During this I started to run into the limitations of what iOS Shortcuts can do. I was getting close to 17 Shortcuts, started to lose the overview & also data handling writing logic was getting more and more complex.

Therefor I decided to build this into a standalone ionic application and possibly extend this concept with further nice to have features.

If anyone is interested in the first POC / iOS Shortcuts solution feel free to reach out and I can share them with you :)
